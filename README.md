Crusher is **no-code e2e web testing/monitoring** built for devs a.k.a _selenium on steroids_.

Integrate **user flow and visual regression** without managing infra, creating a framework or managing breaking selectors.

> Dev has evolved a lot in last decades, testing not so much, our goal is to help dev ship HQ software. We started this because we were genuinely frustrated from current worflows. Read more about philosophy.

## üöÄ Start using Crusher

**Start with crusher cloud for free**

## üîÆ Features

- Create test without writing code. We track basic action by creating a fork of chromium.
- Test UI and compare pixel perfect with last version
- Replay user flows within test.
- Latest chromium support.
- Auto-hover detection functionality.
- Detailed reports with video and e2e repors (coming soon)
- Scheduled monitoring (EE feature)
- Github integration and Alerting (EE feature)
- All browser + different browser version(EE feature).
- Super easy deploy using Docker or Heroku.
- Host it on your infra or Crusher cloud.

We're still early and need to do a lot of things to build this as a complete platform. If you require a feature, please file it in the github issues tab.

## üí° Philosophy

Web is becoming more and more complex everyday, we have dozens of API and infra items.

Due to nature of complexity it'll be hard to avoid bugs/issues, but we should know where, when and how's it breaking.

## üòé What's so cool about this

As devs, we work hard to build software. Although, in the process some tasks are boring, hard and eat up our energy.

We call it noise, it can be UX or workflow noise. At first we reimagine existing workflow and then UX . At the end, we're creating better software for people who create software.

We want to be a platform, solving boring dev tasks and hence improving workflow. We take inspiration from Figma, Linear and Loom on software they create.

For us it's both about how it looks and feels, which is often missing in SaaS. Also, We're open source for individual use and source available at large scale.

Note :- Major FE revamp is underway for ^.
