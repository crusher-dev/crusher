**Philosophy**

Web is becoming more and more complex, we have dozens of API. Different framework, things will break due to complexity of systems we create.

But we should know where, when and how's it breaking.


**What's so cool about this**

As engineers, we work tirelessly to execute our vision. In the process some tasks are repetitive, boring and take most of workflow time, they eat up both our time and energy.

We call it noise, it can be UX or worflow. At first we improve workflow and then UX . At the end, we're creating better software for people who create software.

We want to be a platform, solving boring dev tasks and hence improving workflow. We take inspiration from Figma and Linear.

For us it's both about how it looks and feels, which is often missing in SaaS. Also, We're open source for individual use and source available at large scale.
