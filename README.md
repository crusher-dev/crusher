Crusher is open-source **no-code e2e web testing/monitoring**. E2E testing is grueling and frustrating. We're reimagining the whole workflow to make it blazingly simple and fast.

You can integrate **user flow and UI regression** testing without going thru hassle. All without managing infra, creating a framework or managing breaking selectors.

Software development has evolved a lot in the last decade, but testing is still the same. Devs should be able to ship better software faster. We started this because we were genuinely frustrated with testing workflows.

## 🚀 Demo

Here's how testing should be in 21st century

- **Test UI** and compare **pixel perfect** change with the last build.
- Replay tests recording to debug faster.
- **Run test on chromium** (Open source) and **all browsers** supported (EE).
- Primitive user actions detection.
- Production monitoring (EE feature)
- **Integrate with Github**/Other services as Build check (EE feature)
- **Get alerts when build fails.**
- Report accessible by everyone in the team.
- Host in your own secure private network.

We're still early. If you face bug/feature request, please file a new issue :D.

## 💡 Philosophy

Software dev is getting more complex, with tons of APIs coming in. Things break due to various reasons & it's going to increase in the future.

This leads to angry customers, stakeholder and your product/startup becomes chaotic which could be avoided easily.

Knowing when/where things break is very critical. Good workflow are needed to make it simple to deliver HQ software fast.

## 😎 What's so cool about this

Testing is not new. There are tons of solutions out there, still testing is an unsolved piece of the puzzle in the dev lifecycle.

We try to reimagine how testing should work. Few things that differentiate us

1.) UI first approach. The web is about how it looks, and we help you ship pixel-perfect UIs. As devs, we work hard to build software. Although, in the process, some tasks are boring, grueling, & eat up our time.

2.) No-code/low-code for primitive action. We use no-code to detect primitive user actions.

3.) Removing noise from dev workflow. We are reimagining how processed, should be.

4.) Making things simple and fast. We take inspiration from Figma, Linear :D.


## 🛣️ Some use cases

- Testing your app e2e with each commit or in dev.
- Testing responsiveness of your UIs.
- Ensuring your app across different browsers.
- Alerting system when any component stops working.
- Debug system that helps you when something breaks.
- Creating automated tools or scraping data from site.
- Or maybe keeping an eye on your competitor 👀

## Is Crusher the right choice for me?

- Do you want to have complete testing suite?
- Does your site break in production and staging?
- Do you want a super simple to use software?
- Do you care about quality of your web app?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Crusher would be a great fit for your
application. Dgraph integrates seamlessly into most application in < 5 mins.
