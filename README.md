[Crusher](https://crusher.dev) 🦖 is a faster testing framework, an alternative to traditional workflows using cypress, selenium, etc.

**Create, run and debug tests** with dead simple workflow, use **low-code or code**. We're reimagining testing to make it blazingly simple, fast and effective.

## 🚀 Getting started

Read the [Getting Started](https://docs.crusher.dev/getting-started/what-is-crusher) tutorial or follow the steps below:

**Create your first test**

In your git repo run,

```
npx crusher-cli
```

You can use our recorder to create tests or if you're feeling adventurous try writing tests using code with our CrusherSDK.

**Run test**

```
npx crusher-cli test:run
```

You can run test locally on your machine to debug. Run it on cloud to see faster execution.

## 🦖 Features

- 🏆 **Create tests using low-code:** Create tests using our customized recorder based on chromium.
- 📝 **Write tests using code:** Better APIs and more control with native playwright APIs.
- 🔥 **Fast test execution:** No more execution on selenium grid.
- 🔋 **All major browsers supported:** Run tests on chromium, safari, and firefox in seconds.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast:** Built on top of Playwright, Crusher delivers an amazing performance during execution.
- 👏 **Easy integration with your projects:** Use npx base CLI to integrate.
- 🦄 **Central reporting & dashboard:** See how your app is doing overall anytime-anywhere.
- 👨‍💻 **Built for developers:** Use modern javascript to write tests with dead-simple workflow.

Crusher is built on playwright as the base to give you the best developer experience you need for testing. We're building a customized toolkit to upgrade the testing experience, by focusing heavily on the engineering + product side.

## 🏃 Use cases

- **Test e2e user flows:** Never compromise your user experience by testing important end-to-end user flows.
- **Test UI of your project:** Never let a UI change catch you off guard.
- **Run tests locally:** Test specific functionalities of your app easily with a single click.
- **Test with every commit:** Run tests on every commit and add checks on pull requests.
- **Monitor production:** Periodically run tests for your website and get notified if something goes wrong.

## 💡 Philosophy

If you are involved in software development, you are no stranger to things breaking now and then. Sometimes it's because of a small typo/change, and sometimes because of reasons out of your control.

It seems like every time you are changing something, there is a chance that something else might break. The worst part is you have no idea what went wrong until it goes into production and someone reports it.

Testing solves this, but it hasn't evolved. We're changing it by creating an integrated solution that simply works.

## 🧱 Deployment

**Crusher cloud:** 🏖️ Start using | Zero configuration setup. (Recommended: Faster, cheaper and less hassle)

**Self host:** 🧱 Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes. [Docs](https://docs.crusher.dev/development/docker-deploy-locally)

## FAQs

- **I don't have any prior experience, Can I use Crusher?** Yes, we primarily designed crusher to make testing easy.
- **Low-code ain't powerful? I believe in code supremacy:** Fair enough, you can write code too. We might support other top frameworks later on.
- **Why this over selenium, cypress, etc?** With any library, you'll have to spend a lot of time setting up testing workflow. We take care of all the for you.
- **Why the new framework?** Testing has not evolved. We still have old flaky APIs that don't work.
- **Is crusher using electron?** We need to use chromium to build the recorder and also to run tests locally. We also modify V8 and Blink to make the recorder more powerful.
