<h1 >Crusher: automate test fast with low-code</h1>

Crusher is a new fast testing framework, it's opinionated and takes low-code first approach. 

An alternative to slow wokrflows built with unreliable libraries (w high learning curve), gluing tools, repetitive script.

Crusher is build from groupup as an all-in-tool, with recorder, SDK, Infra + batteries built-in.


**Crusher is in beta(v0.5)**. Join [Crusher's discord](https://discord.gg/dHZkSNXQrg) and help us make it better 🚀

## 💡 Philosophy
If you are involved in software development, you are no stranger to things breaking now and then. Sometimes it's because of a small typo/change, and sometimes because of reasons out of your control.

It seems like every time you are changing something, there is a chance of stuff breaking. The worst part is you're lost, and then someone reports the issue in prod.

Testing solves this, but it hasn't evolved. It's too complicated and sometimes hard. We're solving it by creating an integrated solution that simply works.

## 🧱 Deployment

**Crusher cloud-**  [Start using](https://crusher.dev) | Zero configuration setup

**Self host:** Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes. [Docs](https://docs.crusher.dev/development/docker-deploy-locally)

## FAQs

- **I don't have any prior experience, Can I use Crusher?** Yes, we primarily designed Crusher to make testing easy. If you have used a browser before, you can use Crusher.
- **Low-code ain't powerful, I believe code is more powerful:-** Fair enough, we believe in both. We're also working on a code-first approach.
- **Why use this over selenium, cypress, etc?** With any library, you'll have to spend a lot of time setting up the testing framework for your project. With us, you can start testing right away. We're also built on top of playwright, which is a more stable and faster automation library.
- **Why a new framework?** Testing has not evolved. It can be quite frustrating to setup and maintain. With Crusher, we're trying to make it easy and fun.
- **Is Crusher using Electron?** Yes, we forked Electron to create our own chromium-based browser.
