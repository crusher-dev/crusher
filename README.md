Crusher is open source **no-code e2e web testing/monitoring**. E2E testing is super hard and frustrating, we try to make it easy thru low-code approach.

You Integrate **user flow and visual regression** without managing infra, creating a framework or managing breaking selectors.

Software development has evolved a lot in last decade, testing is still the same. Devs should be able to ship better software faster.
We started this because we were genuinely frustrated from testing worflows.

## üöÄ Start using Crusher

**Start with crusher cloud for free**
Fastest and most powerful way to try Crusher. Click to get started.

**Deploy it on your own infra (self-host)**

## üîÆ Features


- Create **test without nocode/low code**. We track basic action by creating a fork of chromium.
- **Test UI** and compare pixel perfect with last version
- Replay user flows within test.
- All major browsers supported (EE). 
- Primary user action detection.
- Scheduled monitoring (EE feature)
- Github integration and Alerting (EE feature)
- All browser + different browser version(EE feature).
- One click deploy using Docker or Heroku.

We're still early. If you face bug/feature request, please file a new issue :D.

## üí° Philosophy

Software dev is getting more complex, we have tons of APIs. Things break due to various reason and it's going to increase in future.

Knowing when/where things break is very critical. Hence good worflows are needed to make it simple to deliver HQ software.

## üòé What's so cool about this

Testing is not new. There are tons of solution out there. It's like battery, wheels, chasis all were there but no one created tesla for a while.

We try to reimagine how testing should work. Few things that differentiate us

1.) UI first approach. Web is about how it looks, we try to help you ship pixel perfect UIs.
As devs, we work hard to build software. Although, in the process some tasks are boring, hard and eat up our energy.

2.) Putting low-code to right use. We use no-code to detect primitive user actions.

3.) Removing noise from dev workflow. We are reimagining how processed, should be.

4.) Making things simple and fast. We take inspiration from Figma, Linear :D.
