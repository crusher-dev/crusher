Crusher is **no-code e2e web testing/monitoring** built for devs  a.k.a *selenium on steroids*.    
  
Integrate **user flow and visual regression** without managing infra, creating a framework or managing breaking selectors.     
    
     
> Dev has evolved a lot in last decades, testing not so much, our goal is to help dev ship HQ software. We started this because we were genuinely frustrated from current worflows. Read more about philosophy.

## 💡 Philosophy  
  Web is becoming more and more complex everyday, we have dozens of API and infra items.     
  
Due to nature of complexity it'll be hard to avoid bugs/issues, but we should know where, when and how's it breaking.  
  
## 😎 What's so cool about this   
 As devs, we work hard to build software.  Although, in the process some tasks are boring, hard and eat up our energy.  
    
We call it noise, it can be UX or workflow noise. At first we reimagine existing workflow and then UX . At the end, we're creating better software for people who create software.    
    
We want to be a platform, solving boring dev tasks and hence improving workflow. We take inspiration from Figma, Linear and Loom on software they create.    
    
For us it's both about how it looks and feels, which is often missing in SaaS. Also, We're open source for individual use and source available at large scale.    
  
Note :- Major FE revamp is underway for ^.
