[Crusher](https://crusher.dev) is an all in one, faster testing framework, an modern replacement to traditional workflows using cypress, selenium, etc.

**Create, run and debug tests** with dead simple workflow, use **low-code or code**. We're reimagining testing to make it blazingly simple, fast and effective.

- **Run tests locally:** Test specific functionalities of your app easily with a single click.
- **Test with every commit:** Run tests on every commit and add checks on pull requests.
- **Monitor production:** Periodically run tests for your website and get notified if something goes wrong.

## 💡 Philosophy
If you are involved in software development, you are no stranger to things breaking now and then. Sometimes it's because of a small typo/change, and sometimes because of reasons out of your control.

It seems like every time you are changing something, there is a chance that something else might break. The worst part is you have no idea what went wrong until it goes into production and someone reports it.

Testing solves this, but it hasn't evolved. We're changing it by creating an integrated solution that simply works.

## 🧱 Deployment

**Crusher cloud-**  [Start using](https://crusher.dev) | Zero configuration setup
(Recommended: Faster, cheaper and less hassle)

**Self host:** Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes. [Docs](https://docs.crusher.dev/development/docker-deploy-locally)

## FAQs

- **I don't have any prior experience, Can I use Crusher?** Yes, we primarily designed crusher to make testing easy. Most developer have never tested.
- **Low-code ain't powerful? I believe code is more powerful:** Fair enough, you can write code too. We might support other frameworks later on.
- **Why use this over selenium, cypress, etc?** With any library, you'll have to spend a lot of time setting up testing workflow. For us the whole experience was frustrating, from both time and reliability.
- **Why a new framework?** Testing has not evolved. We still have old flaky APIs that don't work.
- **Is crusher using electron?** We need to use chromium to build the recorder and also to run tests locally. We also modify V8 and Blink to make the recorder more powerful.
