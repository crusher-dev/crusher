Crusher is **no-code e2e web testing/monitoring** built for devs  a.k.a *selenium on steroids*.  

Integrate **user flow and visual regression** without managing infra, creating a framework or managing breaking selectors.   
  
   
> Dev has evolved a lot in last decades, testing not so much, our goal is to help dev ship HQ software. We started this because we were genuinely frustrated from current worflows. Read more about philosophy.

## Philosophy
  
Web is becoming more and more complex, we have dozens of API. Different framework, things will break due to complexity of systems we create.  
  
But we should know where, when and how's it breaking.  
  
  
## What's so cool about this 
  
As devs, we work hard to build process.  Although, some tasks are boring, hard and eat up our energy.
  
We call it noise, it can be UX or worflow. At first we improve workflow and then UX . At the end, we're creating better software for people who create software.  
  
We want to be a platform, solving boring dev tasks and hence improving workflow. We take inspiration from Figma and Linear.  
  
For us it's both about how it looks and feels, which is often missing in SaaS. Also, We're open source for individual use and source available at large scale.
