:::note What you'll learn?

1. How to run tests with a different host with CLI?
2. Set up monitoring with different hosts/environments
:::
   Testing workflow is not always limited to running tests for one domain/host. Depending on your use case, you may want to run your tests for,

- Staging/testing environment
- Instant environment
- Local development

With crusher, you can easily do all this in minutes

## Prerequisites

- **Crusher CLI**: If you haven't already setup your project using crusher-cli, don't worry it's super easy. [Check out this doc](using-cli-in-project)
- Some tests to run ðŸ¤“

## Using `--host` flag

```shell
npx crusher.devtest:run --host https://custom.host.com
```
