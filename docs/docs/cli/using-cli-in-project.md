When running crusher-cli for the first time, we need to link your project. You can choose to create a new project or set it up with an existing project.

Crusher seamlessly integrates with git-enabled projects.

## Set up

To get started, the first thing you need to do is initialize and link your project with crusher. To do that, go to your project directory and run this command,

```shell
npx crusher.devinit
```

Running this command will start the following process,

- You&#39;ll be asked to log in/sign up to link your crusher account
- CLI will download and extract the latest version of the recorder
- If you run this command in a non-git directory/project, you&#39;ll be asked to select a project.

:::note **Note**:
During the setup, we will save configuration files at `~/.crusher/config.json` (global config) and `[project-dir]/.crusher/config.json` (project config)
:::

## Creating a test

```shell
npx crusher.devtest:create
```

This will open up the recorder where you can start recording your test. When you are done click on &quot;Verify &amp; Save&quot;.
:::tip **Recommended**:
If it&#39;s your first time with the recorder, try and finish the recorder onboarding to get an idea of everything crusher has to offer.
