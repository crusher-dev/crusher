## Steps to deploy using docker

Before starting, make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and git installed.

1.) Clone git repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/crusherdev/crusher-docker-deploy.git
```

##### With Postgres/Redis

2.) Start the containers.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

##### Without Postgres/Redis

2.) Change `.env` file and the start the container using

```shell
source .env && docker compose -f docker-compose-plain.yml up
```

3.) Wait for all container to spin up, check status with `docker ps`
