title: Integrating Crusher tests with Jenkins
sidebar_label: With Jenkins
---

Integration with Jenkins can be done easily with the help of `crusher-cli`. This guide will cover how you can trigger tests from your Jenkins pipeline

## Example repo

For reference, you can take a look at the [example repo](https://github.com/crusherdev/crusher-jenkins) which uses jenkins to trigger crusher tests.

## JenkinsFile

```dockerfile
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'circleci/node:12.14.0-browsers'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // run crusher tests
                sh 'npx crusher.devtest:run --token=<random_token_here> --project-id=<your_project_id>'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The above `JenkinsFile` is doing the following things,

1. Using `node:12.14.0` docker image as a base to prepare a basic node environment. (Needed for `crusher-cli`)
1. Triggering tests through `crusher-cli` [test:run](/cli/commands/test:run) command in your project from `â€”token` and -`-project-id` passed. (Look at how to get the token and project id)

## Getting token and project id

To get your user token and project id,

1. Open Crusher and go to `Settings>Integrations`
1. Copy the command from the `CI/CD` command box.
1. Replace the command with the newly copied command.
