Different use-cases where SDK can be helpful:

- Use of _context_ variables, to perform complex flows.
- Interacting with some JS library (third-party or otherwise)
- Perform operations over DOM tree, to find/locate elements
- Custom assertions and logging
- Update _context_ to be re-used in later steps or child-test
  <!-- - Use all crusher-supported actions as code. -->
  <!-- - Mock API routes -->
  <!-- - Use of hooks - to run code at the beginning/end of test/page lifecycle. -->
